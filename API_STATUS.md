### ❌ Reddit - HTTP 403 Forbidden
All subreddits are being blocked with HTTP 403
- Reddit is detecting Cloudflare Workers as a bot
- Need to implement a proxy or different approach

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix:
1. **Check all API keys** - many appear to be invalid or rate limited
2. **Get fresh API keys** from:
   - NewsAPI.org (https://newsapi.org/)
   - GNews.io (https://gnews.io/)
   - TheNewsAPI.com (https://www.thenewsapi.com/)
   - NewsData.io (https://newsdata.io/)
   - NewsAPI.ai (https://www.newsapi.ai/)

### Reddit Fix Options:
1. **Use Reddit's official API** with OAuth (requires app registration)
2. **Use a Reddit API wrapper service** like:
   - Pushshift API
   - PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) via proxy
3. **Wait and retry** - the 403 might be temporary

### Long-term Solution:
- **Upgrade to paid API plans** to avoid rate limits
- **Implement caching** to reduce API calls
- **Rotate between multiple API keys**
- **Use RSS feeds** as backup source

## Next Steps

1. Verify which API keys you have access to
2. I can help you set up new keys
3. We can implement a fallback system that works with whatever APIs are available
4. Consider adding RSS feed parsing as a backup
